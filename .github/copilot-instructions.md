## CODING_PRACTICES

### Guidelines for VERSION_CONTROL

#### GITHUB

- Use pull request templates to standardize information provided for code reviews
- Implement branch protection rules for main to enforce quality checks
- Configure required status checks to prevent merging code that fails tests or linting
- Use GitHub Actions for CI/CD workflows to automate testing and deployment
- Implement CODEOWNERS files to automatically assign reviewers based on code paths
- Use GitHub Projects for tracking work items and connecting them to code changes


### Guidelines for STATIC_ANALYSIS

#### ESLINT

- Configure project-specific rules in eslint.config.js to enforce consistent coding standards
- Use shareable configs like eslint-config-airbnb or eslint-config-standard as a foundation
- Configure integration with Prettier to avoid rule conflicts for code formatting
- Use the --fix flag in CI/CD pipelines to automatically correct fixable issues
- Implement staged linting with husky and lint-staged to prevent committing non-compliant code

## FRONTEND

### Guidelines for VUE

#### VUE_CODING_STANDARDS

- Use the Composition API instead of the Options API for better type inference and code reuse
- Implement <script setup> for more concise component definitions
- Use Suspense and async components for handling loading states during code-splitting
- Leverage the defineProps and defineEmits macros for type-safe props and events
- Use the new defineOptions for additional component options
- Implement provide/inject for dependency injection instead of prop drilling in deeply nested components
- Use the Teleport component for portal-like functionality to render UI elsewhere in the DOM
- Leverage ref over reactive for primitive values to avoid unintended unwrapping
- Use v-memo for performance optimization in render-heavy list rendering scenarios
- Implement shallow refs for large objects that don't need deep reactivity

#### VUE_ROUTER

- Use route guards (beforeEach, beforeEnter) for authentication and authorization checks
- Implement lazy loading with dynamic imports for route components to improve performance
- Use named routes instead of hardcoded paths for better maintainability
- Leverage route meta fields to store additional route information like permissions or layout data
- Implement scroll behavior options to control scrolling between route navigations
- Use navigation duplicates handling to prevent redundant navigation to the current route
- Implement the composition API useRouter and useRoute hooks instead of this.$router
- Use nested routes for complex UIs with parent-child relationships
- Leverage route params validation with sensitive: true for parameters that shouldn't be logged
- Implement dynamic route matching with path parameters and regex patterns for flexible routing

#### PINIA

- Create multiple stores based on logical domains instead of a single large store
- Use the setup syntax (defineStore with setup function) for defining stores for better TypeScript inference
- Implement getters for derived state to avoid redundant computations
- Leverage the storeToRefs helper to extract reactive properties while maintaining reactivity
- Use plugins for cross-cutting concerns like persistence, state resets, or dev tools
- Implement actions for asynchronous operations and complex state mutations
- Use composable stores by importing and using stores within other stores
- Leverage the $reset() method to restore initial state when needed
- Implement $subscribe for reactive store subscriptions
- Use TypeScript with proper return type annotations for maximum type safety

## TESTING

### Guidelines for UNIT

#### VITEST

- Leverage the `vi` object for test doubles - Use `vi.fn()` for function mocks, `vi.spyOn()` to monitor existing functions, and `vi.stubGlobal()` for global mocks. Prefer spies over mocks when you only need to verify interactions without changing behavior.
- Master `vi.mock()` factory patterns - Place mock factory functions at the top level of your test file, return typed mock implementations, and use `mockImplementation()` or `mockReturnValue()` for dynamic control during tests. Remember the factory runs before imports are processed.
- Create setup files for reusable configuration - Define global mocks, custom matchers, and environment setup in dedicated files referenced in your `vitest.config.ts`. This keeps your test files clean while ensuring consistent test environments.
- Use inline snapshots for readable assertions - Replace complex equality checks with `expect(value).toMatchInlineSnapshot()` to capture expected output directly in your test file, making changes more visible in code reviews.
- Monitor coverage with purpose and only when asked - Configure coverage thresholds in `vitest.config.ts` to ensure critical code paths are tested, but focus on meaningful tests rather than arbitrary coverage percentages.
- Make watch mode part of your workflow - Run `vitest --watch` during development for instant feedback as you modify code, filtering tests with `-t` to focus on specific areas under development.
- Explore UI mode for complex test suites - Use `vitest --ui` to visually navigate large test suites, inspect test results, and debug failures more efficiently during development.
- Handle optional dependencies with smart mocking - Use conditional mocking to test code with optional dependencies by implementing `vi.mock()` with the factory pattern for modules that might not be available in all environments.
- Configure jsdom for DOM testing - Set `environment: 'jsdom'` in your configuration for frontend component tests and combine with testing-library utilities for realistic user interaction simulation.
- Structure tests for maintainability - Group related tests with descriptive `describe` blocks, use explicit assertion messages, and follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern to make tests self-documenting.
- Leverage TypeScript type checking in tests - Enable strict typing in your tests to catch type errors early, use `expectTypeOf()` for type-level assertions, and ensure mocks preserve the original type signatures.
